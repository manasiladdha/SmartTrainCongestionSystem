# SmartTrainCongestionSystem

Application Details:
1)An ecosystem level java application using singleton design pattern to process information from IoT sensors and track real-time space and seat avaliablity in local trains.
2)Scalable multi-user application is developed to build robust interaction between T-Operators, T-Analysts, T-Security and T-Riders.
3)Predictive algoritm designed to alert the T-Riders about the expected drop and increase in the ridership of the running train.
6)The application provides assistance to the travllers on the immediate next station in case of medical/fire/accidental emergencies.
4)Stored sensor data to generate detailed reports for the weekeday and weekend congestion levels during different hours of day on a line.
5)Analyzed data can be used to improve the train capacity during peak congestion times and better utilize resources.

Specifications:
1)The application is developed in JavaSE 7 using NetBeans IDE 8.1.
2)db4o, an open source object database is used to store the application data model.
3)Ecosystem architecture and Singleton Design Pattern
